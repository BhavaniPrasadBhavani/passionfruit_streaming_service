 This README will guide users through setting up and implementing your video streaming service project.

# AWS-powered Video Streaming Service

This project implements a video streaming service using React for the frontend and AWS services (CloudFront and S3) for content delivery.

## Project Flow

1. User requests video service through the React frontend.
2. The request triggers CloudFront.
3. CloudFront fetches the video from the connected S3 bucket.
4. The S3 bucket returns the video to CloudFront.
5. CloudFront delivers the video to the user's browser.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of React and AWS services

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup
1.Install node js in a code editor.
2. Install dependencies:

npm install
Copy
4. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add necessary variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_CLOUDFRONT_URL=your-cloudfront-url`)
npm start
### Backend Setup (AWS)

1. Log in to your AWS account.

2. Create an S3 bucket:
- Open the S3 service in AWS Console
- Click "Create bucket"
- Name your bucket and configure settings
- Upload your MP4 video files to this bucket

3. Create a CloudFront distribution:
- Open the CloudFront service in AWS Console
- Click "Create Distribution"
- Select your S3 bucket as the origin
- Configure distribution settings as needed

4. Update S3 bucket policy:
- After creating the CloudFront distribution, you'll be prompted to update the bucket policy
- Follow AWS instructions to allow CloudFront access to your S3 bucket

5. Note your CloudFront distribution URL for use in the frontend

## Connecting Frontend to Backend

1. In your React app, use the CloudFront URL to fetch video content.
2. Implement video playback using a suitable React video player component.


## Security Considerations

- Never commit AWS credentials to your repository
- Use AWS IAM for managing access and permissions
- Implement proper CORS settings on your S3 bucket

## Troubleshooting

- If videos don't play, check your CloudFront distribution settings and S3 bucket permissions
- Ensure your React app is correctly configured with the CloudFront URL
